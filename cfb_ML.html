            <p> All models were trained on roughly 10,000 college football games from the past 10 years, exlcuding games that occured in the 2020-2021 season because of COVID-19's big impact on the sport. A multitiude of varibles were created and carefully trimmed down to 20 to accurately reflect the team's offensive capabailites, not only in terms of 
                yards per rush/pass but with factors including tempo and explosiveness. The models also incorporate each team's defensive capabilities, looking at how well the defenses can stop explosive plays along with other factors. The model's <b> does not factor in injuries</b>, they assume each team is performing at its average performance so far this year.
                A full list of all factors that the models consider is below:

            <p> * Explosiveness is broken down into 3 categories, plays that generate more than 10 yards, 25 yards, and 40 yards. </p>
            <p> <b> Note on P5/G5 Difference: </b> While I did not include whether a team was P5 or not in the models, I did do early runs with it as a variable. Early versions of the models
            suggested that the difference between an average P5 team and an average G5 team was roughly 8 points. </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"> Team Ranking Algorithm </h2>
        <div style="width: 50%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;text-align: center;">
            <p style="text-align: center;"> The main algorithm used for ranking teams is Glicko 2 where I adapted it for college football. Ratings for each team is reset at the start at each season at <b> 1500 </b> with a standard deviation of <b> 350 </b>.
                A big advantage of this ranking algorithm is that it gives a standard deviation
            on each teams rating, over time as more games are played the rating deviation gets smaller to represent that the model is getting more confident on what is the teams true rating. The paper that explains the algorithm
            in great detail can be found <a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf" class="Not_Header"> <u> Here </u> </a></p>
